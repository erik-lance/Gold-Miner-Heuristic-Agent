hi si erik ito

idea lang, I was thinking of making a folder for the "squares"

option 1:
I was thinking na gawin natin yung GoldSquare and Pit as classes that extends to a certain "square" or "grid" class so that we can have each gridsquare as an "object" para we can call a function to just swap between grids and just check for if a grid contains the goldminer.

option 2:
if we're not going to do that, perhaps just a location checker might suffice? if we'll just do a grid array OR purely update lang the miner's location by changing the x and y values

if it's option 2 we could also probably just handle everything inside a gameboard class? we'll just need an AI.java for the handling


NOTES PART 2

FOR THE SEARCHING PART mukhang we're using search trees nohh correct me if i'm wrongg

kumbaga we'll just add a moveset na parang left forward or right and the machine finds the quickest path to the gold square

if searching blindly though perhaps kailangan nagsesearch siya the WHOLE board so puro forward lang ata yun?

-wawawawa d ko pa gets lesson e HAAHAH
